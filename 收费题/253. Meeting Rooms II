Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

Example 1:

Input: [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1

Approach 1: Priority Queues
We can't really process the given meetings in any random order. The most basic way of processing the meetings is in increasing order of their start times and this is the order we will follow. After all if you're an IT guy, you should allocate a room to the meeting that is scheduled for 9 a.m. in the morning before you worry about the 5 p.m. meeting, right?

Let's do a dry run of an example problem with sample meeting times and see what our algorithm should be able to do efficiently.

We will consider the following meeting times for our example (1, 10), (2, 7), (3, 19), (8, 12), (10, 20), (11, 30). The first part of the tuple is the start time for the meeting and the second value represents the ending time. We are considering the meetings in a sorted order of their start times. The first diagram depicts the first three meetings where each of them requires a new room because of collisions.


The next 3 meetings start to occupy some of the existing rooms. However, the last one requires a new room altogether and overall we have to use 4 different rooms to accommodate all the meetings.


Sorting part is easy, but for every meeting how do we find out efficiently if a room is available or not? At any point in time we have multiple rooms that can be occupied and we don't really care which room is free as long as we find one when required for a new meeting.

A naive way to check if a room is available or not is to iterate on all the rooms and see if one is available when we have a new meeting at hand.

However, we can do better than this by making use of Priority Queues or the Min-Heap data structure.

Instead of manually iterating on every room that's been allocated and checking if the room is available or not, we can keep all the rooms in a min heap where the key for the min heap would be the ending time of meeting.

So, every time we want to check if any room is free or not, simply check the topmost element of the min heap as that would be the room that would get free the earliest out of all the other rooms currently occupied.

If the room we extracted from the top of the min heap isn't free, then no other room is. So, we can save time here and simply allocate a new room.

Let us look at the algorithm before moving onto the implementation.

Algorithm

Sort the given meetings by their start time.
Initialize a new min-heap and add the first meeting's ending time to the heap. We simply need to keep track of the ending times as that tells us when a meeting room will get free.
For every meeting room check if the minimum element of the heap i.e. the room at the top of the heap is free or not.
If the room is free, then we extract the topmost element and add it back with the ending time of the current meeting we are processing.
If not, then we allocate a new room and add it to the heap.
After processing all the meetings, the size of the heap will tell us the number of rooms allocated. This will be the minimum number of rooms needed to accommodate all the meetings.
Let us not look at the implementation for this algorithm.



Approach 2: Chronological Ordering
Intuition

The meeting timings given to us define a chronological order of events throughout the day. We are given the start and end timings for the meetings which can help us define this ordering.

Arranging the meetings according to their start times helps us know the natural order of meetings throughout the day. However, simply knowing when a meeting starts doesn't tell us much about its duration.

We also need the meetings sorted by their ending times because an ending event essentially tells us that there must have been a corresponding starting event and more importantly, an ending event tell us that a previously occupied room has now become free.

A meeting is defined by its start and end times. However, for this specific algorithm, we need to treat the start and end times individually. This might not make sense right away because a meeting is defined by its start and end times. If we separate the two and treat them individually, then the identity of a meeting goes away. This is fine because:

When we encounter an ending event, that means that some meeting that started earlier has ended now. We are not really concerned with which meeting has ended. All we need is that some meeting ended thus making a room available.

Algorithm

Separate out the start times and the end times in their separate arrays.
Sort the start times and the end times separately. Note that this will mess up the original correspondence of start times and end times. They will be treated individually now.
We consider two pointers: s_ptr and e_ptr which refer to start pointer and end pointer. The start pointer simply iterates over all the meetings and the end pointer helps us track if a meeting has ended and if we can reuse a room.
When considering a specific meeting pointed to by s_ptr, we check if this start timing is greater than the meeting pointed to by e_ptr. If this is the case then that would mean some meeting has ended by the time the meeting at s_ptr had to start. So we can reuse one of the rooms. Otherwise, we have to allocate a new room.
If a meeting has indeed ended i.e. if start[s_ptr] >= end[e_ptr], then we increment e_ptr.
Repeat this process until s_ptr processes all of the meetings.
